                "text": "JUNGSAEMMOOL Minifying Cica Mist Balm is a moisturizing balm for sensitive skin that soothes irritation and helps redness. It\u2019s described as having green calamine to tone down redness and cica pine water to calm skin. But I\u2019m unable to find a full ingredient list. The box has directions in English but lacks an ingredient list in English, so I don\u2019t know what\u2019s even in this product. I have dry, sensitive skin and avoid many skincare ingredients, so I won\u2019t make this balm or any product part of my daily routine without an ingredient list.<br /><br />I have used this balm a few times after my moisturizer and before foundation (if wearing makeup). The balm smells light and pleasant, and it adds some comforting moisture. While it tends to sink into my skin, I do get some color correction of redness on my nose and cheeks. But it\u2019s less than I get with my corrective color makeup. If the balm has healthy ingredients that benefit my skin while also correcting some degree of redness, I\u2019d likely prefer it to just hiding redness with makeup. But I can\u2019t judge if the trade off is there without knowing ingredients.<br /><br />This balm also makes my skin smoother. It feels like it might have silicone and/or glycerin and feels a lot like a primer under my makeup. I like the moist and spreadable texture, except it\u2019s so soft I can\u2019t just swipe across the top with the puff for an even amount of product as it smooshes in the balm and gouges out pieces (which I then spread and dab with the puff). It becomes less noticeable as the balm soaks in, but I don\u2019t like that this settles into and emphasizes pores on my nose. This is just okay for me. 3 stars. Made in Korea.",

Don't let the matte finish fool you though, it melts into your skin leaving it moisturized without feeling greasy.<br /><br />My skin is only slightly sensitive and when irritated doesn't react with major noticeable redness or heat.

It\u2019s so light that it\u2019s almost white but has the green color to it. When applied, it reduces redness. It doesn\u2019t do as well as my more pigmented green correctors, but it does a nice job while being hydrating and lightweight on the skin. It\u2019s something that works well before applying foundation. It is lightweight enough to wear well under foundation. It isn\u2019t a primer really, it doesn\u2019t smooth out the skin or fill in pores. But, it does reduce the redness in my skin so then I use less foundation and concealer. If you have a TON of redness or it\u2019s REALLY red, this might not be enough since it isn\u2019t extremely pigmented. But, it will make a difference. I like it isn\u2019t drying on the skin either.<br /><br />I\u2019m just not sure how I feel about it though. It works well on the skin. But, I do like to know what\u2019s in my products. I don\u2019t like that they provided barely any product info, and the ingredients on the product box weren\u2019t in English. They also didn\u2019t include them here on the product page. Not even the product photos provided any real info on the product - what it does, who it\u2019s for, how to use it, ingredients, etc. I had to go to the brand\u2019s website to find out more. Yes, it\u2019s a simple Google search, but it\u2019s not really something you  should have to do.<br /><br />Normally, I would just go to the brand\u2019s website to find the list of ingredients when they\u2019re not included on the Amazon product page. But, the Jung Saem Mool website didn\u2019t have them on their website either. I looked for them elsewhere and did find an ingredient list on Korean Beauty Box, but didn\u2019t think they were accurate because they didn\u2019t include centella asiatica, pine sprout, or green calamine powder, which are supposed to be in this product. So, I translated the ingredients from the box myself. But, I\u2019m not that confident in the ingredients provided on the box.(I included a photo from the box, and also included the ingredients at the end of my review in English)<br /><br />It doesn\u2019t seem like a complete list of ingredients to me. It has the first ingredient as titanium dioxide. It has tocopherol (vitamin E) as the 3rd ingredient. The rest of the ingredient are 7, kind of versions I\u2019d guess you\u2019d call them, of centella asiatica. There\u2019s nothing else listed. It\u2019s kind of odd. The brand\u2019s website said this is supposed to have \u201c2 plants - pine sprout containing fresh moisture and centella asiatica roots.\u201d I saw the \u201ccentella asiatica roots\u201d in the ingredients when I translated them. But didn\u2019t see any \u201cpine sprout.\u201d I also saw something about \u201ccica pine water\u201d on the brand\u2019s website, but again, not sure what that\u2019s supposed to be? The brand\u2019s website also mentioned \u201cNatural green calamine powder covers reddened skin tone.\u201d Again, I didn\u2019t see any calamine powder at all in the ingredients.<br /><br />The 7, I guess versions, of Centella Asiatica are:<br />Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm) - Well known soothing, antioxidant, and moisturizing ingredient. Anti-inflammatory. The main biologically active components are Asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid. All of which are in this.<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm)<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm)<br /><br />Madecassoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm) - One of the main biologically active components of Centella Asiatica. It\u2019s less prominent than it\u2019s sister component, Asiaticoside, but it still contributes to the well-established moisturizing and wound healing abilities of Centella Asiatica.<br /><br />Overall, it works well. It reduces my redness, feels hydrating on the skin, and works well on its own and under foundation. It feels lightweight on the skin. If they provided the full ingredient list, it would be something I\u2019d be willing to purchase. But, right now, I don\u2019t like they didn\u2019t include them and don\u2019t like that they can\u2019t even be found online as far as I could tell. And I just have a hard time believing the ingredient list I translated from the box is the full ingredient list. I don\u2019t know. If the ingredients aren\u2019t a big factor for you, this is nice and works well. If knowing the ingredients are important to you, I\u2019d look elsewhere. There\u2019s other similar products that actually provide a full ingredient list, and a lot of them are far cheaper. I give it 3 stars.<br /><br />How to Use (from brand\u2019s website):<br />Use as last step of skin care routine. Dip puff into content and gently apply and dab on skin.<br /><br />Special Tips (from brand\u2019s website)<br />Carry it in makeup bag or purse for easy supply of moisture to skin when it dries up.<br />Use as lightweight skin tone corrector to correct sensitive skin tone covered by masks instead of applying heavy, caking makeup.<br /><br />FULL INGREDIENTS<br />Ingredients | Titanium dioxide (CI 77891], Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm), Tocopherol, Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm), Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm), Madecassoside (0.0025ppm), Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm), Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm), Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm)<br /><br />**NOTE: Just for reference, 1ppm = 0.0001% (or 10,000 ppm = 1%). So\u2026<br /><br />Centella Asiatica Extract (5,159,235ppm) = 515.9235%<br />*5,159,235ppm is parts per million, so it means there\u2019s 5,159,235 parts of Centella Asiatica in one million molecules<br />Centella Asiatica Leaf Extract (0.035ppm) = 0.0000035%<br />Centella Asiatica Root Extract (0.03ppm) = 0.000003%<br />Madecassoside (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%<br />Madecassic Acid (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%<br />Asiaticoside (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%<br />Asiatic Acid (0.0025ppm) = 0.00000025%",

They\u2019re still easy enough to work with, but I would likely recommend wearing them over a black polish.<br />I show them in one coat with no magnet (obviously very sheer), and with a magnetic coat on top of that (still pretty sheer, but better). I feel they\u2019re slightly pricy for how sheer the formula is, but I would still recommend them because they\u2019re so pretty, and I\u2019ve found Homost to be a pretty reliable brand in the couple of sets I\u2019ve ordered from them. They all cure within 60 seconds. Just know, their bottles feel super tiny, and their brush is definitely very short and small.",
